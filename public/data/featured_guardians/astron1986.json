    {
      "question": "Hello! Who are you and what’s your role in the clan?",
      "answer": "Hello, ZERO guardians! My name is Astron1986 and I’m that guy who spends in Destiny probably too much time.  Trying to help my clan mates as much as I can, posting news and other useful stuff to our chat (well, at least I think it is useful)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why Destiny and not another game?",
      "answer": "If someone told me 2 years ago I would play one single game for more than 1600 hours I would not believe him!  No way!  I think this game is the very first experience for me when I can join my friends and do stuff.  It doesn’t really matter whether it’s raid or killing enemies in crucible, I like both.  I started playing since beta, leveled up my character and basically stopped playing Destiny.  Game felt boring, there was nothing much to do.  Some time later I joined our clan, met new friends and they showed me what this game is about and what playing in fireteam is."
    },
    {
      "question": "What’s your focus in Destiny at the moment?",
      "answer": "While we all are waiting for Rise of Iron release (I’m so excited!) and there is not much to do in PvE world, I’m trying to improve my crucible play style.  At the moment I’m working on my grimoire, trying to max it out before RoI. 25 wins in Rumble is everything I need.  I can do it!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Life of a Guardian: highest high, lowest low?",
      "answer": "I think both happened at the same time.  Do you remember year 1 moments of triumph?  We had to defeat Skolas in Prison of Elders.  It was so hard for me and my friend!  We tried several times, died a lot, no success.  And, finally, more experienced guardian joined us, explained what to do and we killed SKolas! Wow,  I have never been so happy!  I love destiny community.  If you struggle, just ask and someone will help you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What’s the best clan moment you’ve experienced?",
      "answer": "I have had so many great moments with my clan mates and friends of clan. I think the best moments happened in raids or times when we do 3v3 friendly fights.  We don’t do ‘sweat’ style 3v3s, we don’t have any rules or restrictions.  All 6 of us stay in the same party chat, laugh, teabag each other (just a little bit).  Having fun! Looking forward for RoI release, custom games will make our life easier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What part of the clan life do you enjoy the most?",
      "answer": "The camaraderie and spirit."
    },
    {
      "question": "What feature would you like to see added (or removed!) from a future update to Destiny?",
      "answer": "I wish Bungie never gave us Three of Coins.  Exotics are not exotics any more. Xûr is, like he loves to say, just trash collector. I’d like the game to have less RNG or a lot higher drop rates, more quests, less useless weapons perks. We all know it’s so frustrating when weapon with exhumed and guerilla fighter drops, especially when It’s weapon you really want."
    },
    {
      "question": "A dangerous mission on the far edge of the galaxy; you can only bring one weapon and one piece of armor: which are they?",
      "answer": "Armor piece that gives double grenade and my lovely Suros PDX-45. I can save our galaxy with help of my clan mates, don’t worry!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What’s your favorite PvE/PvP weapon?",
      "answer": "I like pulse rifles. In PvE I use Nirwen’s Mercy. Suros PDX-45 is my go to PvP gun. Depending on map I may use Eyasluna (still chasing that god roll) or Mida Multi-Tool."
